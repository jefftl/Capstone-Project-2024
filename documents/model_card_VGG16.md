# VGG16 Model Card

## Model Description

**Input:**
- RGB images resized to 224x224 pixels
- Normalized using mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
- Data augmentation during training: random crops, horizontal flips, color jittering

**Output:**
- Probability distribution across N classes
- Values between 0-1 representing confidence for each class
- Sum of probabilities equals 1

**Model Architecture:**
- 16-layer network (13 convolutional + 3 fully connected)
- Uniform architecture using 3x3 convolutions
- Structure:
  - 5 blocks of convolutional layers
  - Max pooling between blocks
  - Three fully connected layers (4096, 4096, num_classes)
- Total parameters: ~138 million

## Performance
- Training approach:
  - SGD optimizer with momentum 0.9
  - Initial learning rate: 0.01
  - Cosine annealing scheduler
  - Batch size: 32 (limited by memory)
  - Mixed precision training
- Metrics monitored:
  - Training/validation loss
  - Validation accuracy
  - Per-class accuracy
  - Confusion matrix

## Limitations
- Very large model size
- High memory requirements
